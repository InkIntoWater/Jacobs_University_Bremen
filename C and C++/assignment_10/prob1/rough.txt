When I comment out the 'using namespace std;' it shows the error message because 
the code cannot check the standard library to find whether the scopes we declared
in the code, like endl, cout and other c++ functionalities, are declared in the scope or not. 

When we remove the 'Critter::' prefix in one of the methods in Critter.cpp, it 
shows the error message because without the 'Critter::'  our code will not be able
to find out the definition of the properties, like name and hunger, of the critter
as all those properties are declared inside the 'Critter'.
